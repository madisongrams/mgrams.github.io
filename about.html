<h2> Hi, I'm Madison and I'm a second-year Computer Science Major at Georgia Tech! </h2>
<p class = "projects">I'm from Lawrenceville, GA, a city that's about 40 minutes outside Atlanta. I came into my
    first-year at Georgia Tech with plans to major in Biology and minor in Computer Science. While taking
    my first computer science class during Spring 2016, I fell in love with the subject and switched
    my major to Computer Science. Currently, my main interests are in UI design and artificial intelligence. I'm looking to get an internship for Summer 2017!</p>
<br/>
<p class = "projects"> I'm a hardworking and motivated student, passionate about CS.
    My hardwork paid off during my first semester as a CS major, where I got a 4.00 for the semester
    and accepted a teaching assistant position for the class, Discrete Math for CS.
    I love to code and always push myself to learn more beyond the bounds of a classroom.</p>
