<h2> Hi, I'm Madison and I'm a third-year Computer Science Major at Georgia Tech! </h2>
<p class = "projects">I'm from Lawrenceville, GA, a city that's about 40 minutes outside Atlanta. I came into my
    first-year at Georgia Tech with plans to major in Biology and minor in Computer Science. While taking
    my first computer science class during Spring 2016, I fell in love with the subject and switched
    my major to Computer Science. Currently, my main interests are in artificial intelligence.</p>
<br/>
<p class = "projects"> This past summer I was a software development intern at Elavon in Atlanta, GA. I worked primarily on an iOS app
  that allows businesses to handle and process transactions, but I did have some experience with Android as well! I had a great time
  getting to truly experience what computer science is like in the workplace and can't wait to
  experience it more in the future!</p>
  <br/>
<p class = "projects"> I'm a hardworking and motivated student, passionate about CS.
    My hardwork paid off during my first semester as a CS major, where I got a 4.00 for the semester
    and accepted a teaching assistant position for the class, Discrete Math for CS. I thoroughly enjoyed being a
    teaching assistant and am going to be one once again in the fall - this time for the class,
    Computer Organization and Programming, my favorite class so far at Georgia Tech! This class
  covers a wide range of topics and is a student's first exposure to low-level programming, and looks at a computer from the ground up. </p>
