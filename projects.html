<h2 class = "projects"> Pygame Arcade </h2>
<p class = "projects"> Pygame Arcade is a project I worked on in Python, early on in my career as a computer science student.
  Using the <a href = "http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html">pygame module, </a> I've been worked on an "arcade" of games, based on retro video games.
  I ended up making two games based on Pong and AstroRace, but I may still work on more in the future. </p>

<h2 class = "projects">Should I Wear a Jacket?</h2>
<p class = "projects">
    A project I began in the spring and am currently working on, allowing me to experiment with
    JavaScript and JQuery. It's a web application that takes in weather data for a given city
    and informs a user what they should wear, such as the title suggests, a jacket.
    Weather data is currently backed by the OpenWeatherMap API.

<h2 class = "projects">Bubble Bobble GBA</h2>
<p class = "projects"> As a project for one of my classes, I recreated a miniature
  Gameboy Advance version of the NES game, Bubble Bobble, in C. The game features two levels. Short video of gameplay shown below.</p>
